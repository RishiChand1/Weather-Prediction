# Weather_Prediction
Traditionally, climate assessment has been performed reliably by treating the environment 
as a liquid. The current wind condition is being observed. The future state of the 
environment is recorded by understanding thermodynamics and the numerical position of 
the liquid elements. Nevertheless, this traditional arrangement of differential conditions as 
observed by physical models is at times unstable under oscillating effects and uncertainties 
when estimating the underlying states of air. This indicates an insufficient understanding 
of environmental variations, so it limits climate forecasts to 10-day periods because climate 
projections are essentially unreliable. But machine learning is moderately hearty for most 
barometric destabilizing effects compared to traditional techniques. Another favorable 
position of machine learning is that it does not depend on the physical laws of 
environmental processes. 
Background 
For the current situation, India observatory conducts traditional weather forecasting. There 
are four common methods to predict the weather. The first method is the climatology 
method that is reviewing weather statistics gathered over multiple years and calculating the 
averages. The second method is an analog method that is to find a day in the past with 
weather similar to the current forecast. The third method is the persistence and trends 
method that has no skill to predict the weather because it relies on past trends. The fourth 
method is numerical weather prediction the is making weather predictions based on 
multiple conditions in the atmosphere such as temperatures, wind speed, high-and low- 
pressure systems, rainfall, snowfall, and other conditions. So, there are many limitations of 
these traditional methods. Not only it forecasts the temperature in the current month at 
most, but also it predicts without using machine learning algorithms. Therefore, my project 
is to increase the accuracy and predict the weather in the future for at least one month by 
applying machine learning techniques 
Objective (Brief) 
Purpose of this project is to predict the temperature using different algorithms like linear 
regression, random forest regression, and K-nearest neighbour. The output value should be 
numerically based on multiple extra factors like maximum temperature, minimum 
temperature, cloud cover, humidity, and sun hours in a day, precipitation, pressure and 
wind speed.

1. INTRODUCTION
   
Weather prediction is the task of predicting the atmosphere at a future time and a given 
area. This has been done through physical equations in the early days in which the 
atmosphere is considered fluid. The current state of the environment is inspected, and the 
future state is predicted by solving those equations numerically, but we cannot determine 
very accurate weather for more than 10 days and this can be improved with the help of 
science and technology. 
Machine learning can be used to process immediate comparisons between historical 
weather forecasts and observations. With the use of machine learning, weather models can 
better account for prediction inaccuracies, such as overestimated rainfall, and produce more 
accurate predictions. Temperature prediction is of major importance in a large number of 
applications, including climate-related studies, energy, agricultural, medical, or etc. 
There are numerous kinds of machine learning calculations, which are Linear Regression, 
Polynomial Regression, Random Forest Regression, Artificial Neural Network, and K
nearest neighbour. These models are prepared dependent on the authentic information 
gave of any area. Contribution to these models is given, for example, if anticipating 
temperature, least temperature, mean air weight, greatest temperature, mean dampness, 
and order for 2 days. In light of this Minimum Temperature and Maximum Temperature 
of 7 days will be accomplished. 

Machine Learning 

Machine learning is relatively robust to perturbations and does not need any other physical 
variables for prediction. Therefore, machine learning is a much better opportunity in the 
evolution of weather forecasting. Before the advancement of Technology, weather 
forecasting was a hard nut to crack. Weather forecasters relied upon satellites, data model’s 
atmospheric conditions with less accuracy. Weather prediction and analysis have vastly 
increased in terms of accuracy and predictability with the use of the Internet of Things, for 
the last 40 years. With the advancement of Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Scientists 
now do weather forecasting with high accuracy and predictability.

USE OF ALGORITHMS: 
There are different methods of foreseeing temperature utilizing Regression and a variety 
of Functional Regression, in which datasets are utilized to play out the counts and 
investigation. To Train, the calculations 80% size of information is utilized and 20% size 
of information is named as a Test set. For Example, if we need to anticipate the temperature 
of Kanpur, India utilizing these Machine Learning calculations, we will utilize 8 Years of 
information to prepare the calculations and 2 years of information as a Test dataset. The as 
opposed to Weather Forecasting utilizing Machine Learning Algorithms which depends 
essentially on reenactment dependent on Physics and Differential Equations, Artificial 
Intelligence is additionally utilized for foreseeing temperature: which incorporates models, 
for example, Linear regression, K-nearest neighbour, Random forest regression. To finish 
up, Machine Learning has enormously changed the worldview of Weather estimating with 
high precision and predictivity. What's more, in the following couple of years greater 
progression will be made utilizing these advances to precisely foresee the climate to avoid 
catastrophes like typhoons, Tornados, and Thunderstorms.
